# CSV-Editor
Software for editing .csv files
Works only with semicolon-separated .csv

You can create, edit, open or save .csv files. 
The program reads the .сsv file and places the data written 
in it into a table, the cells of which can then be edited.

After editing is complete, you can save your changes 
as a .сsv file using a semicolon as a separator.

The program accepts the file path as a command line 
argument, so you can associate .csv files with it.
